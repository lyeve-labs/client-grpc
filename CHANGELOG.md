## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Initial release.
- Typed functions for SchemaService operations (`listSchemas`, `getSchema`) via the CMS gRPC gateway.
- Typed functions for ContentService operations (`listContent`, `getContent`, `createContent`, `updateContent`, `deleteContent`) with pagination support.
- All functions use the core `HttpClient` interface, allowing drop-in use with the same auth and retry configuration as the REST and GraphQL clients.
